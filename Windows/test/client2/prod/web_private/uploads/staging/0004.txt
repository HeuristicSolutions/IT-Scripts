PaaS:
Not using PaaS mostly due to needing to rework the Deployments


Ecommerce in PaaS:
- The Library code would need to be a separate project referenced by both the ECommerce site and the LB instance.

- If we do ONE Ecommerce site:
	- Must ensure that Payment DLL works with all currently supported versions of LB
	- Custom styles & logos for each client would not work without development effort to change the UI per client

- Use a separate ECommerce site for each LB instance
	- additional cost to deploy and manage
